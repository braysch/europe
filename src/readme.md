# What is EUROPE

EUROPE is a program desined to extract data from churchofjesuschrist.org and ysaprofiles.org. This program was designed speicifcally for one user, me, when I was membership clerk of my local congregation. This program relied on hardcoded links and credentials, so in its current state, it will not run, however, I've create a executable called demo.exe which will give you an idea of how the program functioned (it's also a lot faster because it's not actually a webscraper.)
