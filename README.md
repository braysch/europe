# What is EUROPE?

EUROPE is a program desined to extract data from churchofjesuschrist.org and ysaprofiles.org. This program was designed speicifcally for one user, me, when I was membership clerk of my local congregation. This program relied on hardcoded links and credentials, so in its current state, it will not run, however, I've create a executable called demo.exe which will give you an idea of how the program functioned (it's also a lot faster because it's not actually a webscraper.)

# How to Use EUROPE

Upon running the program, you will be given a set of options:

1) Extract - Scrape membership data from churchofjesuschrist.org and ysaprofiles.org and combine the data into a master list.
2) Update - This feature was never implemented.
3) Report - Display membership information
   1) Ward Status Report - Displays full member list, members with only a church record, members with only a YSA profile, and members with both.
   2) Display Inconsistencies - For each member, information discrepencies between churchofjesuschrist.og and ysaprofiles.org are displayed.
   3) Display Changes - Displays members who have been added/removed since the last extraction.
4) Optimize - Format membership data on website. This may be done for either or both sites.
5) Publish - This feature was never implemented.
6) Edit
   1) Merge - Merge duplicate members.

?) Displays information about options.

q) Exits program.

# Retrospective Observations

* When I originally wrote this program, it did not loop.
* Sometimes I used the strings `"True"` and `"False"` instead of booleans `True` and `False` (like a psychopath.)
* There is no error checking in the merge function. This user has to type the merging members' names perfectly or the program will crash.
* The discrepency checking does not account for differing states.
* There is no functionality to copy data from 43rd Ward Master List.txt to Backup.txt (which means I just copied it over manually every time.)

Why are there so many unresolved bugs? Because I had just learned Python, I knew how to work around the bugs, and the lifespan of this project was not very long. Otherwise, I would have taken more time to fine-tune it.
